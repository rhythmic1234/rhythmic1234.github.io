# Getting back
I've been trying to use Notion to make my blog posts prettier. Notion would allow me to use different page layouts, which I cannot do with markdown files. In addition to those, I wanted to use a custom domain for my blog.

But there were few drawbacks I did not like:

- The publicly shared Notion page URL is ugly, so I want to hide that
    - So, I don't prefer redirecting my domain to that URL.
- Paid services like Super and Potion are expensive for me
- There is a cool workaround, [Fruition](https://fruitionsite.com/), but it is still too cumbersome for me.


So I'm back to Github pages ðŸ™ƒ
